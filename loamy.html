        <li><b>PLANT GROWTH</b> <br>
            The mixture of differently sized particles in loam soil is ideal for air and water flow and for root penetration.
             Soil that crumbles easily indicates a good loamy soil structure because the sand, silt and clay particles are clumped into granules.
              Loam soils contain enough sand to drain water but enough clay and silt to hold the moisture needed by many kinds of plants. The silt grains contain nutrients and help to make the soil workable.
               If you grow plants that prefer a light, dry soil, such as cacti, however, then loam soil is not ideal. 
            It may be too heavy and drain too slowly for the roots of those plants.
        </li>
         <li>
            <b>EROSION</b><br>
            Loam soils have excellent structure, which refers to the clumping or aggregation of the minerals into larger clusters. 
            The moist composition of loam soils makes them easier to work with than other soil types, but it also makes the soils more likely to erode. 
            This is because loam soils have high amounts of silts and fine sands, and they have moderate to low permeability. 
            So while water is retained easily in loam soils, it does not enter into it easily to increase bulk and density.
             As a result, the particles in loam soils have a tendency to detach. 
             If soil is disturbed by rain, wind or construction, its silt and clay particles are transported easily and the soil can begin to erode.
         </li>
         <li>
           <b>STRUCTURE AND TEXTURE</b><br>
           Occasionally. loam soil contains more of one particular element than other elements, yet it still is considered loamy.
            This is sometimes confusing for gardeners who are told that loamy soils are ideal. 
            While a true loam soil, with equal parts of each soil element, provides ideal growing conditions for many plants, not all loam soils are the same. Clay loams are predominantly clay and tend to be heavy and slow-draining. They also can be difficult to work with and can harden during dry conditions. Sandy loams are predominantly sand. They’re much easier to work with and drain well, but they tend to dry out faster than clay loams, losing nutrients in the process. Silty loams are predominantly silt, and tend to settle into a heavy, airless mass. Silty loams also are prone to compaction. Because loam soils have such a broad range in texture and structure, they tend to be more versatile than other soil types.
            They do not have the extreme characteristics of pure forms of their predominant material.
             That makes them easier to work, and you can add amendments to make them better suit your plants.

                <div id="wisteria.jpg" style="display:none">
                    Wisteria is a large genus of climbing flowering plants related to the pea family. Native to Japan and China, Wisterias lavishly adorn pergolas, trellises and fences in the United States, Europe and Australia with their characteristic white and violet blue blossoms. Common wisteria species include the Chinese wisteria (Wisteria sinensis), Japanese wisteria (Wisteria floribunda) and Wisteria venusta. Wisterias prefer well-drained, fertile, loamy soil rich in nutrients and organic matter.

              <div id="dogflower.jpg" style="display:none">
                Dog’s tooth violet (Erythronium) is a hardy spring flowering genus of nearly 30 species. Also called trout lilies, dog’s tooth violets are common to the woodlands of temperate North America and Europe. The plants prefer cold temperatures and loamy, moist soil. European dog’s tooth violet (E.dens-canis) produces a carpet of green leaves with nodding lilac or pink flowers. The California fawn lily (Erythronium californicum), common to the coastal regions of California, bears yellowish-white flowers in early spring. The citrus fawn lily (Erythronium citrinum) is another dog’s tooth violet species common to California and Oregon. The plant blooms in spring to produce white flowers with greenish patches. All dog’s tooth violet species prefer well-drained, loamy soil.

              <div id="rubus.jpg" style="display:none">
                Rubus tricolor, also called Chinese bramble, is a deciduous shrub of the rose family of plants. The plant forms a thick green mat and bears red fruit and white, five-petaled flowers in the summer. The plant, therefore, gets its name from the three colors of its foliage, fruit and flowers. The hardy rubus prefers full to partial shade and loamy, moist soil.

              <div id="Delphinium.jpg" style="display:none">
                Delphinium, or larkspur, is a large genus of flowering plants native to the Northern Hemisphere. The genus prefers loamy soil and is partial to full sun exposure and cool, moist summers. Delphiniums are common to gardens owing to their gorgeous white, purple, blue and pink summer-blooming flowers. All parts of the plants contain the toxic alkaloids delphinine and ajacine, among others, and can be fatal if ingested.

              <img src="eucalyptus.jpg" style="width:100%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="EUCALYPTUS">
              <div id="eucalyptus.jpg" style="display:none">
                In their native range, eucalyptus trees grow in well-drained, gravelly substrates. Interestingly, the majority of their roots tend to occur in the top layers of soil. 
                This adaptation is a result of having to exploit occasional rainfall in environments that are otherwise dry and nutrient-poor for long periods of time.
                 Many eucalyptus species have become naturalized in countries that don’t pose the same challenges as their native bush regions. 
                In the fertile soils of the West, they can grow remarkably quickly and aren’t threatened by hungry kangaroos, koalas, and insects that can eat young trees to death! This is why a single eucalyptus tree can grow up to 10 feet (3 meters) a year when away from potential grazers and poor, shallow soils.

                    Flowering crabapples are close relatives of the world-famous orchard apple tree. 
                    In fact, they belong to the same genus of short deciduous trees, Malus. Most species tend to do well in sandy soil as they prefer proper drainage, but may require frequent watering sessions to keep the soil moist.
                     If located in the US, search for the following native species: Malus angustifolia, M. coronaria, and M. fusca. 
                    If located in Europe, you may have better luck with the European crab apple (M. sylvestris).

                    The hardy northern red oak is notable for its deep taproot system. 
                    This robust species produces tall, thick trunks that raise flourishing canopies far above the ground.
                     This species can grow to more than 100 feet (30 meters) tall and can reportedly live up to 400 years!

No less than impressive, the northern red oak is definitely easy to identify as its bark is marked by ridges that appear to shine.
 Its leaves, which can extend to 10 inches (25 cm) and have gradually tapering lobes, turn a stunning shade of red or brown in fall.
