    <p> <ul>
        <li><b>Hold More Water</b> <br>
            Clay beds naturally hold more water than other types of soil. Sandy soils don’t hold enough water; clay soils don’t allow enough air into the soil to retain moisture. Vegetables require a deep, well draining soil with sufficient organic matter for good root development. Good garden soil with proper amount of moisture will form a soft ball instead of a hard or compact mass if squeezed vigorously in the hand.
        </li>
         <li>
            <b>Ideal Soil For Vegetable Garden</b><br>
            A well-drained garden holds moisture well, enabling it to be used as an alternate growing medium for plants. It is resistant to heat and repels weeds. Due to these properties clay soils are the ideal soil for vegetable gardens. The clay soils can be either used directly on the plant roots or mixed into the soil for bedding.
         </li>
         <li>
           <b> Holds Moisture Well</b><br>
           When clay soil is directly applied to the plant, it holds moisture well, which is important for planting vegetable seeds. With consistent moisture, seedlings grow healthy and normally stay alive for a long time. As the plant grows and matures, it stops producing new leaves but keeps the same moisture level within the soil. In this way, the nutrients Leach out gradually and the soil develops excellent drainage for water absorption.

         </li>
         <li>
           <b>High Quality Nutrients</b> <br>
           The soil that retains moisture also offers high-quality mineral nutrients and trace elements. It is an excellent source of potassium, nitrogen and phosphorus. However, due to its inability to retain moisture it is inappropriate for crop fields. Clay clays, as its name suggests, are rich in clay particles, as clay soils are naturally clayy. Clay particles attract water-loving microorganisms that rapidly increase the fertility of the soil.


         </li>
         <li>
            <b>Plant For Long Periods</b><br>
            You cannot install a vegetable garden on clay soils without mixing some sand. But you can plant vegetables in clay soils for long periods by keeping in mind some important factors. Clay soil is usually moist enough during hot weather; therefore, you don’t have to water as much or frequently. However, it can get too wet during wintertime or droughts. In such situations you can water regularly, just make sure you dig up all the sand before planting.

                <div id="clay11.jpg" style="display:none">
                    The crab apple or 'Malus' is one of the best trees to grow in clay soils as it offers interest throughout the year – and is also a great pollinator. 
                    In spring, this beautiful tree is covered in a profusion of white blossom with green foliage in summer. 

                    In fall, they bear fruits which are beautifully decorative and can range from glossy red to pink-flushed orange to yellow.
                     Due to its high levels of pectin – most commonly used to thicken jams, jellies, and preserves – the fruits are often used to make Malus ‘Jelly King'.
                    
                    They are compact trees only growing to a mature height and spread of  around 13ft, so are perfect for smaller gardens. 
                    They thrive in full sun with moist soil that is well-drained. 

                </div>
              <img src="clay12.jpg" style="width:100%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="ALDER">
              <div id="clay12.jpg" style="display:none">
                Alder – or Alnus glutinosa – grow vigorously in cool, wet conditions and are often found by rivers and lakes making them a good choice for sites with poor drainage. 

                ‘In the Pacific Northwest where there is clay soil, we also usually have drainage issues due to all of the rain we get here.
                 A good choice for these types of environments, rain and clay soils, are Alders,’ says Lisa Tadewaldt of Urban Forest Professionals(opens in new tab).
                
                
                ‘Two great choices are White Alder Alnus rhombifolia or Red Alder Alnus rubra.
                 The toughness of these trees is really the primary reason to plant them.’
                
                Alders have racquet-shaped, leathery dark green leaves with serrated edges and put on a beautiful display of catkins between February and April.

                Birch trees or betula are beloved for their snowy white peeling bark which makes a beautiful feature during the winter months, as well as their elegant form and attractive foliage which turns from mid-green to yellow in fall. 

                ‘This tree can grow in a variety of conditions and is tolerant of heavy moisture, meaning it’s ideal for soils with high clay,’ says Marcus Eyles, horticultural director at Dobbies(opens in new tab).
                
                Betula utilis jacquemontii or the 'Snow Queen' birch is a slender specimen which will grow to around 22ft tall making it a good choice for small garden ideas. Plus, this specimen requires minimal pruning.

              <div id="clay21.jpg" style="display:none">
                Also known as Japanese Dogwood, this abundant semi-evergreen tree offers year-round interest with flowers, fruits – and beautiful red leaves in fall. 
                Come June, it features four-petalled creamy white flower bracts which turn pink over time and come fall it bears pink strawberry-like fruits. 

                It can be planted in all soils but prefers a position that is moist but well-drained in full sun or part shade. 
                It is suited to growing zones 5-8. 
            </div>
              <img src="clay22.jpg" style="width:100%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="MAGNOLIA X SOULANGEANA ">
              <div id="clay22.jpg" style="display:none">
                A spring show-stopper, this deciduous tree, also known as the Saucer or Chinese Magnolia, has large tulip-shaped flowers in late spring, these are white with a pink tinge at the base and can be scented.
                 Its obovate leaves are glossy green, but they start of red in spring before turning to yellow in fall. 

                The Saucer Magnolia grows to a height of 20ft–30ft tall with a 25ft spread and prefers moist but well-drained soil. 
                In North America it is suitable for growing zones 4-9.  
                
                Heavy pruning can cause shock; remove damaged or overcrowded branches or prune to shape in late summer early fall. 
            </div>
              <img src="clay23.jpg" style="width:100%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="AMELANCHIER ">
              <div id="clay23.jpg" style="display:none">
                Also known as the Snowy Mespilus, or Juneberry tree, the Amelanchier is a good, hardy tree for growing in poor conditions.

‘The amelanchier is a great tree for clay soil and is known for its clusters of white blooms in spring and splendid fall color,’ advises Marcus Eyles, horticultural director at Dobbies(opens in new tab). 
‘This tree thrives in moist soil so is perfect for planting in heavier, clay soils that take longer to warm up, and will add drama and interest to your garden year-round.’

Offering plenty of interest from season to season, Amelanchier has bronze tinged foliage in spring, turning to green in summer and to orange-red in fall, it also bears a star-shaped flowers in spring followed by berries that ripen in summer and turn from dark red to purple black.

                <div id="clay32.jpg" style="display:none">
                    Also known as the ‘Golden Chain’ tree due to its beautiful trails of golden yellow flowers, Laburnum is a small deciduous tree that can be grown alone or trained around arbors. 

                    Fantastically, it is quick growing and low maintenance as it does not require pruning. 
                    You can simply tidy it up and remove damaged branches during the dormant period. Laburnums will flower better in full sun but can tolerate some shade and will not do well in the heat or waterlogged soils.  They are hardy in the UK and are suited to USDA planting zones 5-7.
                    
                    Be area that Laburnum is highly toxic to humans and animal.
