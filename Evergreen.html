						<h1>American Arborvitae</h1>
						<p>Features tiny, scale-like leaves that are packed closely together in overlapping rows on branchlets, displaying in a flattened, fan-like spray.
Adapts well to shearing and shaping.Yields light brown or reddish-brown oblong cones that are ⅜–½" long and persist through winter; cone scales are blunt-tipped and separate from each other at the base
Can be planted 3' apart for a low-maintenance hedge
Grows in a pyramidal shape

						<img src="rubber.png" alt="" />
						<h1>Rubber</h1>
						<p>In the wild, the rubber tree will grow to heights of 100 to 130 feet, and can live up to 100 years. In order to reproduce, the fruit of the rubberwood burst open when ripe, scattering its many seeds in an area spanning up to 100 feet from the tree.It has soft wood; high, branching limbs; and a large area of bark. The milky liquid (latex) that oozes from any wound to the tree bark contains about 30 percent rubber</p>

						<h1>Brazil Nut Tree</h1>
						<p>Brazil nut trees grow to a fantastic height and have a unique shape. It grows to 50 meters tall with a trunk 2 meters wide. It may live for 500 years or more, and can often reach a thousand years of age.The stem is straight and commonly without branches for well over half the tree's height, with a large, emergent crown of long branches above the surrounding canopy of other trees.</p>

						<img src="strangler fig.png" alt="" />
						<h1>Strangler Fig</h1>
						<p>Strangler figs begin life as a sticky seed on a tree branch high up in the canopy and are usually left there by an animal.

Long roots grow down along the trunk of the host tree, eventually completely engulfing the host tree trunk. Once these roots reach the ground, they enter the soil.

Strangler Fig grows quickly and can reach 60 feet in height with an almost equal spread.</p>

						<img src="mahogany.png" alt="" />
						<h1>Mahogany</h1>
						<p>Mahogany tree facts describe the trees as being very tall. They can grow 200 feet. in height with leaves some 20 inches long, but it's more common to see them growing to 50 feet or less. Mahogany trees thrive in very warm climates. They are native to South Florida.
The wood is dense, and the tree can hold its own in strong winds. This makes it useful as a street tree, and trees planted in medians form attractive canopies overhead.

						<p>Giant bamboos are the largest members of the grass family. Bamboos are some of the fastest-growing plants on Earth, with reported growth rates up to 910 mm in 24 hours. However, the growth rate is dependent on local soil and climatic conditions, as well as species, and a more typical growth rate for many commonly cultivated bamboos in temperate climates is in the range of 30-100 mm per day during the growing period.</p>
